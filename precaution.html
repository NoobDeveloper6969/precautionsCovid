Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs in many situations, they should be used in the right situations.Also it is recommended to buy sanitizers with atleast 60% of ethyl alochol in it.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease by stopping chains of transmission of COVID-19 and preventing new ones from appearing.

                These measures secure physical distance between people (of at least one metre), and reduce contact with contaminated surfaces, while encouraging and sustaining virtual social connection within families and communities.</p>

            <p class="card-text">From picking up objects to turning doorknobs, we're constantly touching surfaces contaminated with pathogens. These pathogens can be picked up by our hands and get into the body through mucous membranes on the face — eyes, nose, and mouth — that act as pathways to the throat and lungs.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Cleaning</h5>
            <p class="card-text">It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems likely to behave like other coronaviruses. A recent review of the survival of human coronaviruses on surfaces found large variability, ranging from 2 hours to 9 days (11).

                The survival time depends on a number of factors, including the type of surface, temperature, relative humidity and specific strain of the virus. So we should keep on cleaning the surfaces on a regular basis.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Get a Check Up</h5>
            <p class="card-text">If symptoms become severe — especially if you are having trouble breathing, have pain or pressure in the chest, bluish lips or feel confused — go to your nearest emergency department. Wear a mask before entering the emergency department. If you do not have a mask, ask for one when you arrive. This is necessary to protect yourself, healthcare personnel and other patients.Once you have been assessed, the physician will determine what additional care is needed.</p>
